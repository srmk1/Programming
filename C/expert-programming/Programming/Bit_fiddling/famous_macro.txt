1. Setting nth bit of num
    num = num | (1U << n)
    
2. Clearing nth bit of num
    num =  num & ~(1U << n)
    
3. Toggle the bit
   num = num ^ (1U << n)
   
4. Get nth bit of num
    nthbit = num & (1U << n)
    
5. Write a macro to set bit position from m to n  on a give number
#define MASK32(m,n)    (1<<(n-m+1)-1)<<m
#define SET_BITS(num, m, n)   (num | ( (1<<(m-n+1))-1 << n))
