Asymptotic Analysis:
--------------------
Asymptotic analysis provides basic vocabulary for discussing the design and analysis of algorithms.

It identifies the sweet spot for discussing high level performance of algorithms. 
- On the one hand, coarse enough, to suppress all of the details that you want to ignore. Details that depend on
the choice of architecture, the choice of programming language, the choice of compiler, and so on. 
- On the other hand it's sharp enough to be useful. In particular, to make predictive comparisons between different high level algorithmic
approaches to solving a common problem. This is going to be especially true for large inputs.

High level idea is to surpress constant factors and lower order terms. 
- Constant terms depend on the system, architecture, compiler and so on.
- Lower order terms become irrelevant for large inputs

Bigoh Definition:
-----------------
Worst case running time of the algorithms as a function of input size n (for sufficiently larger values of n).
      T(n) = O(f(n))
      if only if there exists constant values c,n'>0 such that:
        T(n) <= c*f(n)
      for all n > n'
