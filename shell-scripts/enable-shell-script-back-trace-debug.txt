How to enable tracing and debugging on a UNIX shell script


SUMMARY:
If a shell script is returning an error or producing an unexpected behavior, it is possible to trace the step-by-step instructions in a script in order to troubleshoot a shell script problem.

SYMPTOMS:
Shell script returns unexpected error and needs to be traced

SOLUTION:
For tracing a shell script using the various shells available (bash, sh, tcsh, ksh), follow one of the two possible methods below:

Method 1:
Edit the shell script and append "-x" at the end of the first line of the shell script.  
Example:
The following shell script starts with:
#!/bin/sh
Change the line to:
#!/bin/sh -x
Run the script again and a debug output will be shown on the console which shows the trace of the script.


Method 2:
From the command line, run the script by calling explicitly the shell interpreter; use the "-x" parameter followed by the script name.
Example:
# bash -x my_script_name.sh
The debug output will be shown on the console as well as the regular text output from the script.
