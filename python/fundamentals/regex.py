import re

#Metacharacters
#   .   Matches any single character example:".at" matches cat, sat, mat
#  [ ]  Matches any single character contained within [] example:"[csm]at" matches cat, sat, mat
# [^ ]  Matches a single character NOT contained within [] example:"[^c]at" matches sat, mat but not cat
#  ^    Matches the expression if at the start if the string example:"^.at" matches cat, sat, mat
#  $    Matches the expression if at the end if the string example:".at$" matches cat, sat, mat
# ( )   Contains sub expressions
#  *    Matches preceding element zero or more times example:"c.*" would match any word starting with c

#Python implements search and replace using sub() method, substitute
#sub(pattern,replacement_string,original_file_or_string,max=0)

#re.compile(pattern, flags=0)
#Compile a regular expression pattern into a regular expression object, which can be used for matching using its match() and search() methods, described below.
#The expressionâ€™s behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value. Values can be any of the following variables, combined using bitwise OR (the | operator).
#The sequence
#   prog = re.compile(pattern)
#   result = prog.match(string)
#is equivalent to
#   result = re.match(pattern, string)
#but using re.compile() and saving the resulting regular expression object for reuse 
#is more efficient when the expression will be used several times in a single program.
